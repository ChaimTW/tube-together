# Tube Together
> Watch Youtube videos simultaneously

Tube Together is a side project i made that allows you to watch Youtube videos at the same time with everyone that is connected to the same room as you. Everyone can add videos to the queue. The host can change the order of the queue, remove videos and determine what video should be playing as well as from what time. There is an integrated chat as well. The tab 'Webcam' was made but I am not really sure if I want to pursue that due to privacy issues.

Still to do:
* Easy way to invite people
* Visualize all people within the room
* Assign new chat color to everyone in the room
